1. Create a repo with name 'test1' on github (Don't initialize with ReadMe)
2. Create sub directory with same name on local
3. mkdir test1
4. cd test1
4. git init
5. git remote add origin https://github.com/RabizShafiq/test1.git ( add remote)
6. git add filename
8. git commit -m 'message'
9. git push origin master
---------------------------IF get Error following error-------------------

if get error: udates rejected because the remote contains work that you don't have locally.

Then
as we initialize ReadMe file on github repository and our local repo don't have this.
Git guess that we are probably sync both local n remote repos. So we need to update our local repo.
by using pull command which fetches remote repo to local repo.

10. git pull origin master
then again try
11. git push origin master
----------------------Another way --------------
For avoiding above error another approach is cloning, first create github repo and initialize it with ReadMe.
Then clone this repo on local machine

git clone git@github.com:RabizShafiq/test1.git
cloning automatically downloads remote repo to your local and creates subdirectory in your local directory
cd test1
git remote -v
most imp our local repo and remote repo already to sync
git add filename
git push origin master
